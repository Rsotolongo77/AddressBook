# Address Book
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to not only test your ability to solve a problem, but also understand how you go about solving a problem. You do not need to complete this project, but the closer you get the easier it is to evaluate. Once you feel you have done enough we will review your results and talk about what decisions you made and why. It is more important to speak to why you made a decision than making the "right" choice.

## Business Requirements
You are given the task of creating an address book for company employees. You have the option to build it either as a public company directory accessible to everyone or as a private directory for individual users. Whatever you build, your application must contain *at least* these features:
1. Display contacts in a list, in descending order by last name.
2. Users will be able to search contacts.
3. A contact detail view will show when a user selects a contact from the list.
4. Contacts must have *at least* these fields: first name, last name, email, phone number, address, birthdate, and notes.
5. Users will have the ability to create, update, and delete contacts.
 
## Technical Requirements
1. There is no time limit. Take as long as you think you need.
2. You __must__ use a front-end library or framework such as angular, react, vue, etc.
3. You __must__ write a backend component. Here at Kazzcade, we use myriad of languages, including Golang, Python, and Typescript/JavaScript. However, you are free to use whatever language you choose.
4. Provide documentation on how to compile and run your application.

## Extra Credit (but not required)
1. Provide at least one unit test for your client code and one unit test for your backend code.
2. Use routing in your front-end application.
3. Containerize your application using Docker.
